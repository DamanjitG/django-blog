# django-blog
A simple django + bootstrap blog application, built as a learning project. Full credit to [Corey Schafer](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer) and his educational [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g)'s videos & tutorials, as well as many [code snippets](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets).

Note that the code is not functional just by cloning this repository - some sensitive items are environment variables stored in an environment file which is not uploaded to the public repository for security reasons.

The blog is currently deployed via Heroku: https://dgill-django-blog.herokuapp.com/.

Unfortunately, due to restrictions regarding users uploading content to Heroku apps, the profile picture feature is not fully functional on the deployed version.
